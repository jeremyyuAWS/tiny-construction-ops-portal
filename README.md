üõ† PRD: Tiny's AI-Powered Operating System ‚Äì "Riddler"
üìå Phase I Objective

Deploy an AI-powered, multi-agent platform ("Riddler") for Tiny's Demolition & Recycling. The system will automate inbound communications, classify and route documents, monitor for fraud and compliance, and provide real-time decision support for preconstruction workflows ‚Äî all through a centralized dashboard.

üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

## Core Components

### Arbitor (Data Engine & Repository)
- Comprehensive data repository and intelligence engine
- Stores and manages all company data (documents, transcripts, financials, compliance, GPS data, audit trails)
- Enforces permissions and data governance
- Acts as single source of truth for all organizational data

### Riddler (Conversational Interface)
- Conversational user interface for global search and queries
- Interacts directly with Arbitor's data based on user-specific permissions
- Handles natural language queries about company operations
- Examples:
  - "How many dumpsters were used at VUMC Micro Lab?" ‚Üí "17 C&D dumpsters, 3 recycling dumpsters"
  - "Dumpster cost in Chattanooga?" ‚Üí "$450 per 30-yard dumpster, including 5 tons; each additional ton costs $101"
  - "Who provided dumpsters?" ‚Üí "Vendor name, contact info, owner details, and service rating"
- Permission-sensitive queries trigger appropriate security responses

### OpsPortal (Operations Dashboard)
- Central operational dashboard for real-time oversight
- Provides live monitoring of alerts, bid tracking, system health
- Streamlit-based interface optimized for mobile via Jamf
- Daily operating interface for Tiny's team

## Validation Workflow
**Four-Step GPT ‚Üí Grok ‚Üí GPT Process:**
1. ChatGPT interprets user query, retrieves data from Arbitor and external sources (~90% confidence)
2. Grok.ai audits the initial response, identifying gaps or inaccuracies
3. Grok.ai sends detailed refinement prompts back to ChatGPT
4. ChatGPT integrates Grok's feedback, finalizing response (~95%+ confidence)

üß± App Structure (4 Tabs)

1. Agent Gallery

Purpose: Showcase and document each operational agent
Includes:

* Interactive cards for each Phase I agent (Sift, Fang, Triage, BidSentry, etc.)
* Description of logic, triggers, confidence thresholds, outputs
* Sample inputs/outputs for each agent
* Live chat interaction or logs for agents like Sift, Fang, Prod


2. OpsPortal (Core Operations Dashboard)

Purpose: Daily operating interface for Tiny's team
Built with mobile optimization via Jamf
Sections:

* Inbound Activity Feed: Email + call parsing by Sift + Triage
* Bid Tracker: Visual status of detected bids from BidSentry
* Alerts & Flags: From Fang, Shear, and DemoScope
* Tasks + Routing: Synced with monday.com (incl. confidence scores)
* Audit Trail: Escalation logs, redactions, compliance events


3. Field Ops & Compliance

Purpose: Track and validate site-level activity
Features:

* Syncs with DemoField, Field Hustle, and Tenna GPS
* Displays folder structure and file logs (e.g., haul tickets, site photos)
* Compliance overlays from Shear and Jamf lockdown validation
* Alerts on unverified data (e.g., photo not geotagged on site)


4. Insights & Retraining

Purpose: Data-driven oversight + monthly model improvement
Includes:

* Win/loss tracking powered by Prod and Triage
* Agent performance (volume, accuracy, false positives)
* Summary reports: unread-deleted emails, unresolved flags
* Retraining logs for RAG-type and classifier agents
